This is the source for a shirt.woot iGoogle gadget that can be installed
at http://www.google.com/ig/directory?hl=en&url=gadgets.spacelysgadgets.com/shirtwoot/shirtwoot.xml

The main html/javascript source is in shirtwoot.xml

passthrough.php was added to proxy cthe shirt.woot xml feed since at one point requests directly from 
google were being blocked. Not sure if that's still the case.
